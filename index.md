I am a second-year PhD student in cognitive psychology at the University of Manchester. My research explores the cognitive processes involved in extracting meaning from data visualisations, and the influence of design choices on the interpretation of presented information. As a founder member of the University of Manchesterâ€™s Open Research Working Group, I am passionate about open science and reproducibility.

Run by the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk)

#### March 2022
  * Presented my research  *The Influence of Blank Space and Axis Range on Perceived Magnitude in Data Visualisations* at the [Experimental Psychology Society's](https://eps.ac.uk) Spring Meeting (Keele University). Awarded Grindley Grant for conference attendance.

#### February 2022:
  * Attended *Introduction to Causal Inference and Directed Acyclic Graphs* workshop, which explained how expressing data-generating mechanisms graphically prior to analysis assists in defining key causal processes, where experimental designs are infeasible.
