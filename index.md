I am a first-year PhD student in cognitive psychology at the University of Manchester. My research explores how we interpret information presented in data visualisations. I am interested in the cognitive processes involved in extracting meaning from data visualisations, such as inference-generation. As a founder member of the University of Manchesterâ€™s Open Research Working Group, I am passionate about open science and reproducibility.
